# pqc-inventory

![CI](https://github.com/Edward3113/pqc-inventory/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A scanner that builds a cryptographic inventory of network endpoints and grades each
algorithm against NIST's post-quantum transition timeline (NIST IR 8547).

> **Status:** Milestone 2 of 7 — single-host TLS inventory with policy grading. SSH, hybrid
> PQ detection, CycloneDX CBOM output, and the lab/report pipeline are on the roadmap below.

## Why

Most TLS and SSH traffic today relies on RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography, which a
cryptographically relevant quantum computer could break. NIST has proposed deprecating
these algorithms after 2030 and disallowing them after 2035. Traffic recorded today can
be decrypted later ("harvest now, decrypt later"), so organizations need to know where
quantum-vulnerable key exchange lives on their networks now. You can't migrate what you
haven't inventoried.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
uv run pqc-inventory example.com -f text                # human-readable graded report
uv run pqc-inventory 192.168.1.10:8443 -o reports/host.json   # full JSON (scan + grade)
uv run pqc-inventory example.com --fail-on broken       # exit code 2 if anything is broken
```

### Example: github.com (September 2026)

```
Verdict: QUANTUM-VULNERABLE
Harvest-now-decrypt-later exposure: YES
Earliest NIST IR 8547 deadline: 2030
Findings — broken: 0, weak: 0, quantum-vulnerable: 5, quantum-ready: 0

[P3] QUANTUM-VULNERABLE  key_exchange    secp256r1
[P3] QUANTUM-VULNERABLE  key_exchange    x25519
[P4] QUANTUM-VULNERABLE  certificate     leaf: RSA-2048
...
```

A well-configured site with no classical weaknesses still grades as quantum-vulnerable:
every key exchange and signature is on NIST's retirement timeline.

## How grading works

Each finding gets a status and a migration priority:

| Priority | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Broken | Weak today, regardless of quantum (TLS 1.0/1.1, RC4, static RSA, RSA < 2048, SHA-1 signatures) |
| P2 | Weak | Discouraged today (CBC-mode suites) |
| P3 | Quantum-vulnerable key exchange | Recorded traffic can be decrypted later: *harvest now, decrypt later* |
| P4 | Quantum-vulnerable certificate | Signatures can only be forged once a quantum computer exists |
| P5 | Quantum-ready | Hybrid or pure post-quantum (e.g. X25519MLKEM768, ML-DSA) |

Key exchange ranks above certificates because confidentiality loss is retroactive and
signature forgery is not.

NIST deadlines depend on classical security strength (NIST SP 800-57): 112-bit algorithms
such as RSA-2048 are deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035, while 128-bit and
stronger algorithms such as P-256, X25519, and RSA-3072 are disallowed after 2035. IR 8547
is still a draft, so the dates live in [`rules.yaml`](src/pqc_inventory/policy/rules.yaml)
rather than in code.

## Roadmap

- [x] 1. TLS inventory for a single host
- [x] 2. Policy engine: grade findings as broken / weak / quantum-vulnerable / quantum-ready
- [ ] 3. Hybrid post-quantum key exchange probe (X25519MLKEM768 via OpenSSL 3.5+)
- [ ] 4. SSH scanning
- [ ] 5. CIDR range scanning with concurrency
- [ ] 6. CycloneDX 1.6 CBOM + HTML report with prioritized migration list
- [ ] 7. Docker lab targets, CI scan, GitHub Pages demo report
